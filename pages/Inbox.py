##### Update Main:

-> Play too high or low in pitch.
- Plan A: Comparing the user's recording with the sample piece and selecting the difference among them. Data are digitalized.
- Plan B: Using music21 to read the piece and generate the demo of the performance. Then, comparing the user's performance with music21's sample. (this can be a solution for tuner.)
-> Play too fast or slow for the rhythms.

##### Additional ideas to Main.
